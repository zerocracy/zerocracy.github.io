Before you start, make sure you understand that:

  * You will not be paid [for the time](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/07/21/hourly-pay-modern-slavery.html) you spend;
  * You will be paid [only when you close](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/01/09/micro-budgeting.html) tickets;
  * You will be paid for [reported bugs](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/02/06/where-to-find-more-bugs.html);
  * Nobody will [teach](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html) or help you;
  * You will have no boss;
  * There will be [no chats](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html) or discussions.

Ready to try? Here is how.

<!--more-->

First, you need a mentor, who will [invite](/policy.html#1) you.

To find a mentor, fill out [this form](https://www.0crat.com/join).
Your application will be sent to our [most active programmers](https://www.0crat.com/team).
Some of them may get interested and will contact you back.

If this doesn't happen, join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/zerocracy) and ask there
(we recommend you join the group in any case).

If nobody is interested, ask any QA of Zerocracy to help you, to find any just ask in 
[Telegram group](https://t.me/zerocracy).

Next, when you are invited, [identify](https://www.0crat.com/identify) yourself.
You will have to do it online through a mobile app.
If that method doesn't work, [email us](mailto:identity@zerocracy.com) your ID.

Now, talk to our Telegram bot: [@zerocrat_bot](https://t.me/zerocrat_bot).

Ask him to change your [hourly rate](/policy.html#16).

Then, if you are totally new to Zerocracy, [apply](/policy.html#2) to one of our
[sandbox projects](https://www.0crat.com/board).
Your application will be reviewed and you will get
a `DEV` (developer) role in a few hours (up to 24). Then, Zerocrat
will start assigning you tasks, according to his [own algorithm](/policy.html#3).

If you already know the project, which you want to join, ask its architect
to [assign](/policy.html#13) `DEV` role to you. You may also ask the architect to give
you a few tasks to start with.

Now, a few hints before you start working:

  * Your first tasks will most likely need more time than the
    [30-minutes](/policy.html#4)
    budget they will have. Remember, that you are not supposed to always
    complete them all entirely. You may (and should!) leave some parts of them
    incomplete; just add TO-DO markers, which we call
    [puzzles](https://www.yegor256.com/2010/03/04/pdd.html).

  * You will have problems in completing your first tasks, because
    the project is new and you don't know how things are designed there.
    Don't try to learn them! Don't waste a minute of your time for studying
    the code. Instead, submit new tickets, asking the project to document
    things for you and resolve all your concerns. You
    [will be paid](/policy.html#29) for those tickets.

  * Forget about chats, meetings, and phone calls. We
    [never](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html)
    discuss any technical questions outside of GitHub tickets. Never! If you
    have a question about your task, post a message to the ticket. If you have
    a question about the code base and its design, submit
    [new tickets](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html).

If you have any non-technical questions, ask your mentor.

Study our [Policy](/policy.html), it explains everything you need to know about Zerocracy.

Good luck!
