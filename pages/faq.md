Before you start, make sure you understand that:

  * You will not be paid for the time you spend;
  * You will be paid only when you close tickets;
  * Nobody will [teach](https://www.yegor256.com/2015/02/16/it-is-not-a-school.html) or help you;
  * You will have no boss;
  * There will be [no chats](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html) or discussions.

Ready to try? Here is how.

First, you need a mentor, who will [invite](/policy.html#1) you.

To find a mentor, fill out [this form](https://www.0crat.com/join).
Your application will be sent to our [most active programmers](https://www.0crat.com/team).
Some of them may get interested and will contact you back.

If this doesn't happen, join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/zerocracy) and ask there.

If nobody is interested, ask Yulia in Telegram: [@yuliya_bodak](https://t.me/yuliya_bodak).
She will help you out.

Next, when you are invited, [identify](https://www.0crat.com/identify) yourself.
You will have to do it online through a mobile app.
If that method doesn't work, email us your ID.

Now, talk to our Telegram bot: [@zerocrat_bot](https://t.me/zerocrat_bot).
Ask him to change your [payment method](/policy.html#20).

Then, ask the bot to change your [hourly rate](/policy.html#16).

Then, if you are totally new to Zerocracy, [apply](/policy.html#2) to one of our
[sandbox projects](https://www.0crat.com/board).
Your application will be reviewed and you will get
a `DEV` (developer) role in a few hours (up to 24). Then, Zerocrat
will start assigning you tasks, according to his [own algorithm](/policy.html#3).

If you already know the project, which you want to join, ask its architect
to [assign](/policy.html#13) `DEV` role to you. You may also ask the architect to give
you a few tasks to start with.

Now, a few hints before you start working:

First, your first tasks will most likely need more time than the
[30-minutes](/policy.html#4)
budget they will have. Remember, that you are not supposed to always
complete them all entirely. You may (and should!) leave some parts of them
incomplete; just add TODO markers, which we call
[puzzles](https://www.yegor256.com/2010/03/04/pdd.html).

Second, you will also have problems in completing your first tasks, because
the project is new and you don't know how things are designed there.
Don't try to learn them! Don't waste a minute of your time for studying
the code. Instead, submit new tickets, asking the project to document
things for you and resolve all your concerns. You
[will be paid](/policy.html#29) for those tickets.

Third, forget about Slack, chats, meetings, and phone calls. We
[never](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/10/07/stop-chatting-start-coding.html)
discuss any technical questions outside of GitHub tickets. Never! If you
have a question about your task, post a message to the ticket. If you have
a question about the code base and its design, submit
[new tickets](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/04/24/right-way-to-report-bugs.html).

If you have any non-technical questions, ask your mentor.

Study our [Policy](/policy.html), it explains everything you need to know about Zerocracy.

Good luck!
