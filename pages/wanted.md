If you are a member of Zerocracy, you may greatly contribute
to our business by writing a short blog post about your experience
of working with us. Each _published_ blog post will be paid:
64 [ZLD](https://www.zold.io).

These are the questions we need answers for:

  * What were your biggest problems when I was starting up?
  * How do you plan your time with microtasking?
  * How much help do you get from your mentor?
  * Does it make sense to be a mentor?
  * What is important when reviewing pull requests?
  * How do you explain a customer all the principles of work?
  * How do you make the most out of each project, money wise?
  * How freelancing is different from full-time work for you?
  * How do you combine full-time work and freelancing?

You can use your own subject too, just make sure it somehow goes along with
those proposed above.

When you are ready to contribute, just create your post as a Markdown
file in [this directory]() and submit a pull request. You can use the
[`sample.md`]() page as an example. Your pull request will be reviewed
and you will get zolds to the wallet associated with your GitHub name,
in the [WTS](https://wts.zold.io).
